# DevTools Extension

The glade_forms package includes a Flutter DevTools extension that helps you inspect and debug your form models during development.

## Features

The glade_forms DevTools extension provides:

- **View Active Models**: See all active `GladeModel` instances in your application
- **Inspect Inputs**: View the current values and validation states of all form inputs
- **Monitor State**: Track whether forms are dirty, pure, valid, or invalid in real-time
- **Real-time Updates**: Watch as forms change while you interact with your application

## Installation

The DevTools extension is automatically available when you add `glade_forms` to your project. No additional setup is required.

## How to Access DevTools

### Option 1: Using VS Code

1. Run your Flutter application in debug mode (press `F5` or click "Run and Debug")
2. Once the app is running, open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS or `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux)
3. Type "Dart: Open DevTools" and select it
4. DevTools will open in your browser
5. Look for the **"Glade Forms"** tab in the DevTools interface

### Option 2: Using Android Studio / IntelliJ IDEA

1. Run your Flutter application in debug mode
2. Click the "Flutter DevTools" button in the toolbar (or go to `Run` → `Open DevTools`)
3. DevTools will open in your browser
4. Navigate to the **"Glade Forms"** tab

### Option 3: Using Command Line

1. Run your Flutter application in debug mode:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
2. Once running, the console will display a message with a DevTools URL
3. Open that URL in your browser
4. Navigate to the **"Glade Forms"** tab

### Option 4: Direct Launch

You can also launch DevTools independently and connect to your running app:

```bash
dart devtools
```

Then navigate to the provided URL and connect to your running Flutter application.

## Using the Extension

Once you have DevTools open:

1. **Start your app in debug mode** - The extension only works with apps running in debug mode
2. **Navigate to the "Glade Forms" tab** - You should see it in the top navigation bar
3. **Interact with your app** - As you fill out forms, the extension updates in real-time
4. **Inspect form state** - Click on models and inputs to see detailed information

## What You Can See

### Form Models
View all `GladeModel` instances that are currently active in your application, including:
- Model type and instance ID
- Overall validation state (valid/invalid)
- Dirty/pure state
- List of all inputs in the model

### Input Fields
For each model, inspect individual inputs:
- **Input key** - The unique identifier for the input
- **Input type** - Whether it's a string, int, date, etc.
- **Current value** - The actual value stored in the input
- **Initial value** - The value the input started with
- **Validation state** - Whether the input is valid or has errors
- **Error messages** - Any validation errors currently active
- **isPure** - Whether the input has been modified from its initial value
- **isUnchanged** - Whether the current value matches the initial value

### Validation Results
See detailed validation information:
- Active validation errors with translated messages
- Warning messages
- Conversion errors (when input cannot be converted to expected type)
- Which validator rules failed (e.g., "isEmail", "minLength", etc.)

## Debugging Workflow Example

Here's a typical workflow for debugging a form issue:

1. **Run your app** and navigate to a form that's having issues
2. **Open DevTools** and go to the Glade Forms tab
3. **Fill out the form** in your app
4. **Watch the extension** update in real-time as you type
5. **Identify the problem**:
   - Is a field showing as invalid when it should be valid?
   - Is the form dirty state incorrect?
   - Are validation messages not appearing?
6. **Inspect the specific input** causing issues to see:
   - Exact validation errors
   - Current vs. initial values
   - Which validation rules are failing
7. **Make changes** to your validation logic and hot reload
8. **Verify the fix** immediately in DevTools

## Benefits for Development

The DevTools extension makes it easier to:
- **Debug form validation issues** - See exactly why a field is invalid
- **Understand form state** at any point in time without adding print statements
- **Test validation rules** without writing temporary debug code
- **Identify which inputs are causing validation failures** in complex forms
- **Verify dirty/pure state tracking** is working correctly
- **Monitor form behavior** in real-time as users interact with your app

## Troubleshooting

### Extension doesn't appear in DevTools

- Ensure you're running a Flutter app that uses `glade_forms`
- Make sure the app is in debug mode (not release or profile)
- Try restarting DevTools
- Verify `glade_forms` is in your `pubspec.yaml` dependencies

### Extension shows "No data available"

- Make sure you have active `GladeModel` instances in your app
- Navigate to a screen that uses `GladeFormBuilder` or creates `GladeModel` instances
- If models are created but not visible, they may have been garbage collected

### Data not updating in real-time

- Ensure you're interacting with the form in your app
- Verify the app is still running and connected to DevTools
- Try refreshing the DevTools extension tab
