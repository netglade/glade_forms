# DevTools Extension

The glade_forms package includes a Flutter DevTools extension that helps you inspect and debug your form models during development.

## Features

The glade_forms DevTools extension provides:

- **View Active Models**: See all active `GladeModel` instances in your application
- **Inspect Inputs**: View the current values and validation states of all form inputs
- **Monitor State**: Track whether forms are dirty, pure, valid, or invalid in real-time
- **Real-time Updates**: Watch as forms change while you interact with your application

## Installation

The DevTools extension is automatically available when you add `glade_forms` to your project. No additional setup is required.

## Using the Extension

1. Run your Flutter application in debug mode
2. Open Flutter DevTools
3. Navigate to the "Glade Forms" tab
4. Interact with your app to see form states update in real-time

## What You Can See

### Form Models
View all `GladeModel` instances that are currently active in your application, including:
- Model type and instance ID
- Overall validation state (valid/invalid)
- Dirty/pure state

### Input Fields
For each model, inspect individual inputs:
- Input key and type
- Current value
- Validation state and error messages
- Whether the input has been modified

### Validation Results
See detailed validation information:
- Active validation errors
- Warning messages
- Conversion errors

## Benefits for Development

The DevTools extension makes it easier to:
- Debug form validation issues
- Understand form state at any point in time
- Test validation rules without writing temporary debug code
- Identify which inputs are causing validation failures
