# DevTools Extension

The glade_forms package includes a Flutter DevTools extension that helps you inspect and debug your form models during development.

## Features

The glade_forms DevTools extension provides:

- **View Active Models**: See all active `GladeModel` instances in your application
- **Inspect Inputs**: View the current values and validation states of all form inputs
- **Monitor State**: Track whether forms are dirty, pure, valid, or invalid in real-time
- **Real-time Updates**: Watch as forms change while you interact with your application

## Installation

The DevTools extension is automatically available when you add `glade_forms` to your project. 

Update devtools_options.yaml to include the Glade Forms extension:

```yaml
description: This file stores settings for Dart & Flutter DevTools.
documentation: https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools/extensions#configure-extension-enablement-states
extensions:
  - glade_forms: true
```

# Widgets for Debugging
You can use the following debug widgets to help visualize and debug your forms during development:

Use `GladeFormDebugInfo` widget to display properties of your model. It helps you to understand what is going on in your model.

```dart
Column(children: [
    GladeFormDebugInfo<MyModel>(),

    // ... my form 
]);
```

Note that you can customize which properties are displayed.

GladeFormDebugInfoModal.show(context, your_model);
```
