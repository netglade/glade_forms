description: Building dynamic lists of forms

Composed forms are ideal when you need to manage multiple instances of the same form. The number of forms doesn’t need to be known in advance — new instances can be added or removed at any time.

The core building block of this system is the `GladeComposedModel`, which maintains and manages a list of individual `GladeModel` or even another `GladeComposedModel` instances contained within the composed form.

Because `GladeComposedModel` extends `ChangeNotifier`, any dependent widgets automatically rebuild when the model changes.

**Using a composed model**

Composed models behave just like ordinary `GladeModel` objects — they are even provided with the same `GladeModelProvider` and consumed with `GladeFormBuilder`:

```dart
GladeModelProvider(
  create: (context) => MyComposedModel([MyFormModel()]),
  child: GladeFormBuilder<MyComposedModel>(
    builder: (context, composedModel, child) => ...
  ),
)
```

**Managing contained models**

You can dynamically add or remove form models:

```dart
composedModel.addModel(model);
composedModel.removeModel(model);
```

Whenever any contained form model changes — or a model is added or removed — the entire composed form builder rebuilds to reflect the updated list.

**Rendering multiple identical forms**

Since all form models within a composed model share the same type, it's often helpful to automatically generate the same form widget for each model. This is where `GladeComposedListBuilder` comes in. It iterates through all models and builds the appropriate form widget for each one.
