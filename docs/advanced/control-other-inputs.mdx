Sometimes, it can be handy to update some input's value based on the changed value of another input. As developer you have two options.

You can listen for `onChange()` callback and update other inputs based on input's changed value. An example could be automatically updating the `Age` value based on checked `VIP Content` input (checkbox).

```dart
// In vipContent input
onChange: (info, dependencies) {
  if (info.value && ageInput.value < 18) {
    ageInput.value = 18;
  }
}
```

The second approach is to use `dependencies` and `onDependencyChange` callback and react when different dependencies are changed. Note that it works with groupEdit() as well. In that case, onDependencyChange is called once for every changed dependency.

In this example, when age-input update its value (dependency), checkbox's value (vipInput) is updated.

```dart
 vipInput = GladeBoolInput(
    inputKey: 'vip-input',
    dependencies: () => [ageInput],
    onChange: (info) {
      if (info.value && ageInput.value < 18) {
        ageInput.value = 18;
      }
    },
    onDependencyChange: (key) {
      if (key.contains('age-input')) {
        vipInput.value = ageInput.value >= 18;
      }
    },
 );
```
